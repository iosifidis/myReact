# My React programs

Here you can find the programs I wrote during learning React and some I wrote myself. Enjoy!!!

* [Roll the dice](https://github.com/iosifidis/myReact/tree/main/roll-the-dice): It's a program you roll 2 dices. Might be useful for playing backgammon or other board game.  


Once you download the repository, in order to run the program you must follow these steps:
1) `cd directory`
2) `npm install`
3) `npm start` 

**Notice**: You must have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
